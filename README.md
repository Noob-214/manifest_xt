- Device sources must have proper commit history & authorship.
- All sources must be fully synced (pushed to GitHub) prior to every official build release
- Maintainers must test every build before release this including with testers if possible in order to avoid issues
- A Forum thread link must be made using [Official template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Project-Xtended/docs/master/XT-ThreadTemplate.txt) with your build on a dedicated community like XDA for example.
- Forum thread must contain all the device documentation such as installation steps,download links, sources etc.
- All hardware & basic sensors function must be operational
